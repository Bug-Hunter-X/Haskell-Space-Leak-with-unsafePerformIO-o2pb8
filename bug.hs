This Haskell code suffers from a space leak due to the improper use of `unsafePerformIO`. The `generateLargeList` function creates a massive list in memory, but the list is not explicitly freed.  This is exacerbated because `unsafePerformIO` bypasses Haskell's garbage collector's normal operation. The garbage collector relies on referential transparency; bypassing it with `unsafePerformIO` can lead to unexpected memory management issues.

```haskell
import System.IO.Unsafe

generateLargeList :: Int -> [Int]
generateLargeList n = [1..n]

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let largeList = unsafePerformIO (return $ generateLargeList 10000000) -- Creates a huge list
  print (length largeList) -- Prints the length, but the list remains in memory
```
